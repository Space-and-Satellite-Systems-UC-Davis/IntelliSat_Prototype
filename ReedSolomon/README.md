# Reed Solomon
This is an adaptation of [Reed–Solomon codes for coders](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Reed–Solomon_codes_for_coders).

## Usage

Everything is included in the repository. I included a test file in case someone needs an example.

```
  git clone https://github.com/jackchouchani/reedsolomon.git
  cd reedsolomon
  make
  ./test
  make clean
```
